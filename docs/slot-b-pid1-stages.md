# Slot B post-PID1 initialization

KINIT8/KINIT1 proved PID1 entry. Continue on the frozen normal FIX8 payload;
no earlier checkpoint is left active. All assembly, composition, audits and
boot wrapping are Actions-only, reusing kernel bundle `35040148509`.

## Source order and proof boundaries

Linux `init/main.c` and the matching Actions-exported function disassembly:

1. `kernel_init` waits for `kthreadd_done`, then calls `kernel_init_freeable`.
2. `kernel_init_freeable` performs memory/task setup, `smp_prepare_cpus`,
   workqueue/RCU setup and pre-SMP initcalls, then calls `smp_init`.
3. `smp_init` returns before scheduler topology, driver initcalls,
   `wait_for_initramfs`, console setup and rootfs access.

A positive entry checkpoint proves the preceding path, never its overwritten
function body or `/init`. Next-stage device execution depends on the actual
previous result; this is not an automatically executed device matrix.

## FREE8/FREE1 frozen pair

Target `kernel_init_freeable` VA `0xffff800081b3103c`, Image offset `0x1b3103c`.
72-byte inline window, original landing word preserved, compact core already
validated by the KINIT pair. Public `35047929982`, private pack plus independent
verify `35048049205`; only delay-immediate bytes differ. Both boots 37380096 B.

| member | boot SHA256 |
| --- | --- |
| FREE8 | `9c294a544cf1e178b7f638a40901fbddf97e3556ff57f18646114cd2d921be93` |
| FREE1 | `8cf15312cd5803d33c8e889c5a87ad22edaa050da5455a92e68c37adfffffa19` |

Both originate from healthy Android A → ADB bootloader → verified B. Boot
images run in RAM; B stays stock V14 vendor/DTBO plus P15 recovery. A, vbmeta
and firmware are never flashed. Each member executes once. FREE1 requires a
valid automatic B Fastboot return from FREE8 and unchanged protected partition
hashes. Primary delta is FREE1−FREE8 = −7s; abs(error)<=1s STRONG, <=2s
SUPPORTED. No return/manual recovery invalidates the pair and stops automatic
progression. Absolute timing alone is not proof. A positive proves the
`kthreadd_done` wait completed, not SMP or `/init`.
